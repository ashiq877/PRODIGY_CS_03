# Password Strength Checker

## Overview
The **Password Strength Checker** is a Python GUI application built with `tkinter`. It evaluates the strength of a password based on the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, whitespace, and special characters. The program provides feedback on password strength and includes options to generate and copy passwords.

## Features
- **Password Strength Evaluation**: Checks for lowercase, uppercase, digits, whitespace, and special characters to determine password strength (score out of 5).
- **Password Generation**: Generates a strong random password with letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Copies the password to the clipboard.
- **Clear Input**: Clears the password input field.
- **Animated Progress Bar**: Displays a colored progress bar indicating password strength:
  - Red for weak
  - Orange for moderate
  - Green for strong

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No additional dependencies are required; `tkinter` is part of the Python standard library.

## Installation
Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

## Usage
1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python password_strength_checker.py
   ```
2. Enter a password in the input field and click **Check** to evaluate its strength.
3. Use **Generate Password** to create a random password.
4. Click **Copy Password** to copy the password to the clipboard.
5. Click **Clear** to clear the input field.

## Password Strength Evaluation
Password strength is based on the following criteria:
- Presence of lowercase letters
- Presence of uppercase letters
- Presence of digits
- Presence of whitespace
- Presence of special characters

Each fulfilled criterion adds to the password's strength score (out of 5), with feedback provided in the result box.
